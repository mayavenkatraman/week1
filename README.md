goalmaker app

Assignment 1 for iOS for Designers class - 
Time taken : so far - 1.5  hours to mock, 0.5 hours to work in xCode

Tasks Completed:
Completed flow for the Goal Maker App

1) User is at start page
2) Clicking on Sign up or Sign in takes user to the appropriate page 
3) Clicking on the button here takes users to the main app page
4) Users can click on the images (try the one furthest from "you") to go to the Team Creation page
5) Users clicks on invite to send off invites
6) In this flow, I have just jumped us to a "month" view of the list , that also has teammates who have accepted invites
7) user slides right to mark as done and slides left to grab


Design notes and todo stuff for me:
- need to work through font size, line height
- - all pages need a "new task" button below the GoalMaker icon which i just realized i forgot
- need to complete a mock for the calender poping up above

- Need to add in the screen for what happens after grab (shows face) 
- click on user face to filter by that 
- drag and drop face on row to suggest allocation (that user will see their image with alpha and click on it to accept) 
- slide all the way will delete
